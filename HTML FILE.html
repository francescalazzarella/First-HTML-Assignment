        <header>5. Butterfield 8 &#128139</header> <br>

        <header>8. Metropolis &#129302</header><br>

The silent film showcases the disparities amongst societal classes and illuminates how societal structure dehumanizes us. It is creepy because it is accurate.</p>

<testp class="funparagraph">
    As you can see, I have a knack for creepy and sappy old movies. There's something more genuine these movies that take place in an era untouched by smartphones and the internet. I encourage you to watch one and think about how the times have changed. And FYI there is no copyright on Charade or Metropolis. ;)
